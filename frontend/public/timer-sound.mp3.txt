# Timer Sound File

This is a placeholder for the timer sound.

To add a custom timer sound:
1. Replace this file with your own MP3 file
2. Name it exactly as `timer-sound.mp3`
3. Place it in this directory (public/)

The app will automatically play this sound when the timer reaches zero.

Recommended: Use a clear, loud beep or alarm sound that can be heard from a distance during competitions.
